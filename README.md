# DS700-Predictive Modeling: A Case Study of Incoming Cardiovascular Examination Planning
In this final project, we were given a reasonably "real world" (i.e. messy) data set for which we had to take proper assumptions, clean and impute (some advanced methods were used - MICE package) missing values to complete a time series dataset. 

We then evaluated the time series dataset for evidence of trend and seasonality components - first visually, then using a quanitative decomposition process (forecast package). From here, we were able to select appropiate models and fit them to the data. We evaluated their fit and accessed error metrics for best model selection (AIC, RMSE). 

Finally, we make the forecasts using the model and summarize the results. We also consider an ethical/governance lens to the conclusion which would prompt real-world debate prior to releasing a model into production. 

Thanks for checking out the project!
